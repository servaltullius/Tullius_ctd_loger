; How often the helper schedules a main-thread heartbeat update task (ms)
HeartbeatIntervalMs=100

; Blackbox ring buffer capacity (must match shared header constant in this MVP)
; EventCapacity=65536

; Crash hook (VEH). Does not consume the exception.
; 0 = Off
; 1 = Fatal exceptions only (recommended; avoids false positives from handled exceptions during normal gameplay/loading)
; 2 = All exceptions (can false-trigger; use only if you understand the trade-off)
CrashHookMode=1

; Event toggles (MVP: menu events implemented)
LogMenus=1

; Resource tracking (best-effort):
; Logs recent asset loads like meshes/*.nif and animations/*.hkx into the dump so the viewer can map them to MO2 mods.
EnableResourceLog=1

; Performance hitch detection (best-effort):
; If the main thread stalls for too long, we record a "PerfHitch" event.
; This helps identify stutters/FPS drops and correlate with recent resource loads.
EnablePerfHitchLog=1
; Presets (recommended starting points):
;   - Light (more sensitive, more noise):       Threshold=150, Cooldown=1500
;   - Default (balanced; recommended):          Threshold=250, Cooldown=3000
;   - Conservative (only big stutters):         Threshold=500, Cooldown=5000
; Notes:
;   - This is NOT an FPS meter. It detects "main-thread stalls" by seeing when scheduled heartbeat updates run late.
;   - GPU-bound low FPS may not show up as PerfHitch. Script/IO/asset stalls are more likely to show.
PerfHitchThresholdMs=250
PerfHitchCooldownMs=3000

; Auto-start the helper when Skyrim launches (recommended for MO2 users).
; Place SkyrimDiagHelper.exe next to SkyrimDiag.dll (same SKSE/Plugins folder),
; or set HelperExe to an absolute path.
AutoStartHelper=1
HelperExe=SkyrimDiagHelper.exe

; Optional: in-game test hotkeys (OFF by default).
; Ctrl+Shift+F10 -> intentional crash (for validating crash capture)
; Ctrl+Shift+F11 -> intentional hang   (for validating hang detection + WCT/dump)
EnableTestHotkeys=0
