# Changelog

## v0.2.2 (2026-02-03)

### Fixed
- Further reduced Alt-Tab false hang dumps: after returning to foreground, keep suppressing hang dumps while the game window is responsive (and not in a loading screen), until the heartbeat advances.

### Added
- CrashLogger SSE/AE v1.18.0 support: parse and surface the new `C++ EXCEPTION:` details (Type / Info / Throw Location / Module) in evidence, reports, and JSON output.
- DumpTool i18n (EN/KO): English-first UI/output for Nexus + in-app language toggle (persists via `SkyrimDiagDumpTool.ini` and supports CLI `--lang en|ko`).
- DumpTool UI polish: modern owner-draw buttons, better padding (Summary/WCT), WCT mono font, evidence row striping, and Windows 11 rounded corners (best-effort).

## v0.2.1 (2026-02-01)

### Fixed
- Further reduced false hang dumps around Alt-Tab / background pause by keeping suppression “sticky” until the heartbeat advances, and adding a short foreground grace window (`ForegroundGraceSec`).
- Improved CrashLogger SSE/AE log compatibility (v1.17.0+): better detection and parsing for thread dump logs (`threaddump-*.log`) and stack-trace edge cases.

### Added
- Lightweight cross-platform unit tests for hang suppression logic and CrashLogger log parsing core (Linux-friendly, no Win32 deps).

## v0.2.0 (2026-02-01)

### Fixed
- Prevented false hang dumps when the user Alt-Tabs: by default, hang capture is suppressed while Skyrim is not the foreground window (`SuppressHangWhenNotForeground=1`).
- Reduced false positives around menus/shutdown by using a more conservative menu threshold (`HangThresholdInMenuSec`) and a short re-check grace period before writing hang dumps.

### Changed
- DumpTool internal architecture: split into `SkyrimDiagDumpToolCore` (analysis/output) + `SkyrimDiagDumpTool` (UI) to reduce coupling and make future maintenance safer.
- Improved documentation for beta testing and common misinterpretations (manual snapshot vs. real CTD/hang).

## v0.1.0-beta.1 (2026-01-30)

- Initial public beta release.
