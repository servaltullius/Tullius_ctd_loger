# Changelog

## v0.2.3 (2026-02-06)

### Added
- Crash bucketing key (`crash_bucket_key`) output in Summary JSON/Report, plus callstack symbolization improvements to better group repeated CTDs by signature.
- Beginner-first DumpTool UX:
  - Default beginner view with primary CTA (`Check Cause Candidates` / `원인 후보 확인하기`)
  - Top-5 candidate + evidence presentation
  - Explicit `Advanced analysis` toggle to access full tabs.
- DumpTool single-window reuse path: when already open, new dump opens in the same window via inter-process message handoff (`WM_COPYDATA`) instead of creating extra windows.
- New helper viewer auto-open policy options in `SkyrimDiagHelper.ini`:
  - `AutoOpenViewerOnCrash`
  - `AutoOpenViewerOnHang`
  - `AutoOpenViewerOnManualCapture`
  - `AutoOpenHangAfterProcessExit`
  - `AutoOpenHangDelayMs`
  - `AutoOpenViewerBeginnerMode`
- Optional ETW capture around hang dumps (`EnableEtwCaptureOnHang`, `EtwWprExe`, `EtwProfile`, `EtwMaxDurationSec`) as best-effort diagnostics.
- New bucket unit test target (`skydiag_bucket_tests`) and test source (`tests/bucket_tests.cpp`).

### Changed
- Helper dump flow now separates headless analysis from viewer launch:
  - Crash: viewer can open immediately
  - Hang: latest hang dump can be queued and auto-opened after process exit (with configurable delay)
  - Manual capture: viewer auto-open remains off by default.
- DumpTool now persists beginner/advanced default mode in `SkyrimDiagDumpTool.ini` (`BeginnerMode=1|0`) and supports CLI overrides (`--simple-ui`, `--advanced-ui`).

## v0.2.2 (2026-02-03)

### Fixed
- Further reduced Alt-Tab false hang dumps: after returning to foreground, keep suppressing hang dumps while the game window is responsive (and not in a loading screen), until the heartbeat advances.

### Added
- CrashLogger SSE/AE v1.18.0 support: parse and surface the new `C++ EXCEPTION:` details (Type / Info / Throw Location / Module) in evidence, reports, and JSON output.
- DumpTool i18n (EN/KO): English-first UI/output for Nexus + in-app language toggle (persists via `SkyrimDiagDumpTool.ini` and supports CLI `--lang en|ko`).
- DumpTool UI polish: modern owner-draw buttons, better padding (Summary/WCT), WCT mono font, evidence row striping, and Windows 11 rounded corners (best-effort).

## v0.2.1 (2026-02-01)

### Fixed
- Further reduced false hang dumps around Alt-Tab / background pause by keeping suppression “sticky” until the heartbeat advances, and adding a short foreground grace window (`ForegroundGraceSec`).
- Improved CrashLogger SSE/AE log compatibility (v1.17.0+): better detection and parsing for thread dump logs (`threaddump-*.log`) and stack-trace edge cases.

### Added
- Lightweight cross-platform unit tests for hang suppression logic and CrashLogger log parsing core (Linux-friendly, no Win32 deps).

## v0.2.0 (2026-02-01)

### Fixed
- Prevented false hang dumps when the user Alt-Tabs: by default, hang capture is suppressed while Skyrim is not the foreground window (`SuppressHangWhenNotForeground=1`).
- Reduced false positives around menus/shutdown by using a more conservative menu threshold (`HangThresholdInMenuSec`) and a short re-check grace period before writing hang dumps.

### Changed
- DumpTool internal architecture: split into `SkyrimDiagDumpToolCore` (analysis/output) + `SkyrimDiagDumpTool` (UI) to reduce coupling and make future maintenance safer.
- Improved documentation for beta testing and common misinterpretations (manual snapshot vs. real CTD/hang).

## v0.1.0-beta.1 (2026-01-30)

- Initial public beta release.
