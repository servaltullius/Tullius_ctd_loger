# Changelog

## v0.2.0 (2026-02-01)

### Fixed
- Prevented false hang dumps when the user Alt-Tabs: by default, hang capture is suppressed while Skyrim is not the foreground window (`SuppressHangWhenNotForeground=1`).
- Reduced false positives around menus/shutdown by using a more conservative menu threshold (`HangThresholdInMenuSec`) and a short re-check grace period before writing hang dumps.

### Changed
- DumpTool internal architecture: split into `SkyrimDiagDumpToolCore` (analysis/output) + `SkyrimDiagDumpTool` (UI) to reduce coupling and make future maintenance safer.
- Improved documentation for beta testing and common misinterpretations (manual snapshot vs. real CTD/hang).

## v0.1.0-beta.1 (2026-01-30)

- Initial public beta release.
